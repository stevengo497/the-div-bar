# the-div-bar

## User Experience
The div(e) bar is a bar concept where customers can enjoy drinks and food, tailored specifically to web developers and software engineers. The bar is open to EVERYONE, but our menu has a web developer theme to it. With drink items such as Sass on the Beach, ajax and coke and food items such as Shrimp and Gits, any developer will have an amazing time looking at the menu!

The website will also provide an open source page where users can contribute to food/drink menu items. If they have an idea, they can help create it!

###Front-end
React, HTML, CSS, React-Bootstrap: React was used to link all the pages together along with using the Menu Modal. It was a great way to keep organized and also trouble shoot issues. I definitely want to continue my education w/ React after I'm done with the immersive program.

I wanted this front-end to stick with the whole "coding" theme. I didn't know what to do with the homepage. I thought about doing an easy game where users can click on bottles of beer and cans and explode them. I also though about doing a fly in effect with multiple pictures or even a simple carousel effect. I decided to mimic a text editor (atom/sublime) as the background. I used a CSS animation to get the "typewriter" effect on each page. Overall, I'm very happy with how the front-end finally came together. 

###Back-end
The only backend I used is an external API called SendGrid and Form.io. On the contact page, users are able to input their email and information and receive an automatic email back. Form.io was great in helping create the form and linking it to SendGrid.

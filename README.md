# the-div-bar

## User Experience
The div(e) bar is a bar concept where customers can enjoy drinks and food, tailored specifically to web developers and software engineers. The bar is open to EVERYONE, but our menu has a web developer theme to it. With drink items such as Sass on the Beach, ajax and coke and food items such as Shrimp and Gits, any developer will have an amazing time looking at the menu!

The website will also provide an open source page where users can contribute to food/drink menu items. If they have an idea, they can help create it!
